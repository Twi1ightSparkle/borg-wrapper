## Setup

- Clone the repo
- Copy the `sample.config` directory to `config`
- Edit `config/borg.env` and add your config options
- Edit `exclude.txt` and `include.txt` with your requirements. One entry per line
- From the root of the repo, run `./borg.sh --init` to initialize the repo
- Use crontab (or the scheduler of your choice) to run `./borg.sh --backup --automated --live` periodically
- If you need to run multiple profiles, you can use the `--config` option to specify different config files

See [src/help.sh](https://github.com/Twi1ightSparkle/borg/blob/main/src/help.sh) for all command line options.

## env file

As this file contains your backup passphrase, make sure to secure it by giving it permission 600.

Comment out an option to use its default.

All options are prefixed with `BORG_`. It's removed below to make the table nicer to read on GitHub.

## Webhook logging

This is developed for use with [Matrix-Hookshot](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot) generic webhooks. Add
the Transformation JavaScript from `hookshot_webhook_js_transformation.js` to enable @room mentions for errors. Make
sure you give the webhook appservice user permissions to @room. However, this should work with any webhook reader that
accepts unauthenticated `PUT` JSON requests with the key `text`. To edit the behavior, edit the `webhook` function in
`src/utils.js` to fit your needs.
