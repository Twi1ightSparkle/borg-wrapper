## env file

As this file contains your backup passphrase, make sure to secure it by giving it permission 600.

Comment out a option to use its default.

All options are prefixed with `BORG_`. It's just removed below to make the table nicer to read on GitHub.

## Webhook logging

This is developed for use with [Matrix-Hookshot](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot) generic webhooks. Add
the Transformation JavaScript from `hookshot_webhook_js_transformation.js` to enable @room mentions for errors. Make
sure you give the webhook appservice user permissions to @room. However, this should work with any webhook reader that
accepts unauthenticated `PUT` JSON requests with the key `text`. To edit the behavior, edit the `webhook` function in
`src/utils.js` to fit your needs.
